# Note Taken
## Your friendly local storage notes app

[Note Taken](https://danateagle.com/notes) is a client-side notes app written in Typescript and SASS using the Angular framework. Any user of the app can store up to 20 notes at a time (each up to 100 characters in length) in various colours. All inputted data is stored locally without being sent to a database. Unless deleted, the notes will remain in your browser until the next time you clear the cache. The notes can be sorted, filtered, edited, and deleted.

I originally developed it as Pigeon Pad in February 2023 and relaunched it with a new name and improved functionality in September 2023.
