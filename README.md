# Note Taken

## About
[Note Taken](https://danateagle.com/notes) is a notes app built with Angular, Typescript, and SCSS, that stores all inputted data locally without sending anything to a database. Unless deleted, your notes remain secure in the browser on your device until you clear the cache. You can save up to 50 text notes of 140 characters each in various colours. They can be sorted, filtered, searched, edited, and deleted, as well as exported to a .txt file.

## Development
I originally developed the site in Feb 2023 as Pigeon Pad, and then relaunched it as Note Taken in Sept 2023 with improved functionality and an updated design.
