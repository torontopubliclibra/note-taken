# Pigeon Pad

## About

[Pigeon Pad](https://pigeon-pad.netlify.app) is a notes app built by [Dana Teagle](https://danateagle.com). The site is written using the Typescript framework Angular with SCSS for style.

This site allows the user to save up to 12 notes between 1-85 characters in length, in their choice of colours (pink, purple, green, or yellow). It uses the Angular local storage API to store the notes client-side in the browser so the notes are saved until the user's cache is cleared. Also stored in local storage is the user's preference for the built-in dark mode/light mode.

Some basic error handling includes displaying new placeholder text in the textbox when the user attempts to submit an empty textbox, an empty space, a note identical to one already stored, or they have reached the 12 note limit.

## Development

This was my first Angular app and my first app written in Typescript. I wrote it over a weekend in February 2023.
