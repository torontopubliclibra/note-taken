# Note Taken

## About
[Note Taken](https://danateagle.com/notes) is a client-side notes app, written in Typescript and SCSS using Angular. Any user can store up to 20 notes at a time (each up to 100 characters in length) in various colours. All inputted data is stored locally without being sent to a database, and remains in the browser until the next time the cache is cleared. The notes can be sorted by time stamp, filtered by colour, searched by an inputted query, edited, and deleted.

## Development
I originally developed the site in Feb 2023 as Pigeon Pad, and then relaunched it as Note Taken in Sept 2023 with improved functionality and an updated design.
