# Note Taken

## About
[Note Taken](https://danateagle.com/notes) is a client-side notes app, written in Typescript and SASS using the Angular framework. Any user of the site can store up to 20 notes at a time (each up to 100 characters in length) in various colours. All inputted data is stored locally without being sent to a database, and remains in the browser until the next time the cache is cleared. The notes can be sorted, filtered, and edited.

## Development
I originally developed the site in Feb 2023 as Pigeon Pad, and then relaunched it as Note Taken in Sept 2023 with improved functionality and an updated design.
