# Note Taken
## Your Friendly Little Local Storage Notes App

[Note Taken](https://danateagle.com/notes) is a notes app written in Typescript and SASS, using the Angular framework. Any user can store up to 20 text notes (each up to 100 characters in length) in various colours. All inputted data is stored locally in their browser without being sent to a database, so the notes are private and persistent across sessions until the user clears their cache. Notes can be sorted, filtered, edited, and deleted.

I originally developed it as Pigeon Pad in February 2023 and relaunched it with improved functionality in September 2023.
